# My Fork
My fork includes the scroll menu implementation with a one button saber config.

### How to Use
* To activate the menu, you need a long-click in the off() state.
* To scroll through the menu, you need to slowly twist the saber either left or right.
* To select a menu, press the button once.
* To select a sub-menu option and exist, press the button once.
* To go back to the main menu, you need a long-click in the menu state.

#### You will need to load the files from my font repo as per stated in that repos readme.
